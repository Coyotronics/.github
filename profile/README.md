## Welcome to Coyotronics Team 8816

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Coyotronics Members
If you are a coyotronics member (or a Frisco Team), and would like access to the current season's code, please DM me on Discord with your GitHub username.

If you are making changes to any repository please:
- Make a new branch BEFORE YOU MAKE CHANGES with ```git checkout -b branch_name``` (if you already have code on the master branch, you can run ```git stash```, checkout to the new branch, and run ```git stash pop```, to 
transition your changes on a new branch. If you have already created a commit, you will need to run ```git reset HEAD^``` to undo the commit.).
- After you have your changes, run ```git add .```, and then ```git commit -m "Your Commit Message"```
- Then run ```git push```. This might throw an error, you can usually resolve this by running ```git push --set-upstream origin branch_name```
- Then, come to the github link to the repository, and create a merge request, and I will review it.

In order to actually makes the changes, you will need to 
- Download the tools [here](http://192.168.64.3/Admin/Admin-Dashboard.html)
- Navigate to a folder on your computer, and run ```git clone https://github.com/Coyotronics/ChargedUp2023.git```
- Open the folder with VSCode
